Basic OpenGL game engine written in Python and C++.  Rendering engine itself is written in C++ and is rather low effort and current functionality is mostly hardcoded.  The Python scripting layer is bound to the C++ rendering logic via pybind11.  I chose Python to make integration with Tensorflow Lite easy.  This project is paired with my [fork of tensorflow](https://github.com/WHSnyder/tensorflow) that (eventually) allows for integration of GPU delegates with game engines.  Once that fork is operational, this engine will be used with it to test integration of basic style transfer models operating on GL framebuffer textures.
